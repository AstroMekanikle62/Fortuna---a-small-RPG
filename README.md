# Fortuna---a-small-RPG

This a demo of a game i've been working on since the beginning of june.
It's a small old school style RPG with some twists.
I am new to programming so I am sure I made a lot of frustrating practices.

Read the credits and instruction folders for more details.

I finally managed to build the core game, I am planning to add more levels, enemies and items in the future.
what's available now is a test room but with the game functioning as intended.
I am working on adding sounds and battle effects right now.
