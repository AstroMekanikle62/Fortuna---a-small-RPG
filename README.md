# Fortuna---a-small-RPG

After 4 months of constant work it's finally done!
my first programming project, Fortuna is a small-linear-turn based-rpg game with unique twists.

you can start with three player classes all with there unique abilities,
and you must defeat the 8(?) knights of the arcana in your quest for revenge.

the main mechanic of the game is called "Twist of Fate", where every character
alter their abilities depending on their luck.
there are four sacred items hidden in the game that will give you significant advantage
but obtaining them isn't easy.

May Fortuna smiles on you.
