This is an old school final fantasy like rpg (with no random enemies, yet).

-To choose your class use your mouse during the class selection screen.
Each class has three stats: Matter, Spirit , and Fortune.
Enemies have two stats: Matter and Spirit.

*How the stats work:
-matter and spirit are different attack types that you can use during the battle screen.
if your matter is higher than the foe's matter, you will deal the difference as damage to the foe's matter
same for spirit.
And this also applies to the enemy.

-If your matter or spirit are equal to the foe's, then you will deal 1 point of damage.

-If your matter or spirit are less than foe's, you will do no damage.

-fortune govern's the chance of you getting your upward class ability, the more fortune the more likely 
you will get the upward ( good ) class ability. Speaking of which...

-Entering a certain name grants you permenant bonus to some stats, for example if you entered 'athena' as your name
you will get a permenant + 2 to matter. 

-Enemies have 50% chance of landing upward or donward effects, note that unlike you, downward for enemies effects aren't always bad.

*Where is my health bar?
- good question. Will... your stats are your health bar!
if any of your stats drops to 0 (or below) during a battle you will die, similarly for your opponents.

*Class abilities:
-class abilities are effects that acitivates ate start of the battle (called Twist of fate),
each enemy has it's unique class ability
as well. Each ability has an upward (good) effect and downward (bad) effect, it's not always the case for enemies though.

- class abilities are active until the battle ends and all stats gained or lost will be reset to the second
before you entered the battle. Same for your enemies


*Battle:
-when the battle screen shows up you will see the different attack types at the lower right corner of the screen:
press 'm' on your keyboard to do a matter attack
press 's' on your keyboard to do a spirit attack
press ' p' your keyboard to pass your turn

- on the low-midle of the screen you will see your stats that update each turn as will as what happened during twist of fate
at the last line for you and your opponent.

- The big middle section shows what goes on the battle during each turn, blue text indicates your actions while red text
indicates the enemy actons.

the top section of the screen was meant to include you and your enemy characters as well as animations of each attack
but i am still working on it.

- Why would I wan't to pass my turn?
generally that's not a good idea, some enemies like "The Fool" may be triggered by this if you pass too much and eneter
'Flee' state, if an enemy enters 'Flee' state they will run away and drop a special item.

Flee states are unique for each enemy and not only triggered by passing


*Inventory:
- by pressing 'e' on the keyboard, the inventory screen will show up.
the inventory show your permenant stats on the right and the items you have.

- Items have hidden bonuses that are not stated. For example, having 'Cup of Ace' on your inventory increases
the chances of you getting an upward twist of fate (doesn't change your fortune but makes each fortune point have more weight)

*Interaction:
when you press space infront of a character a pop up box will appear, when you press space again it will close.
enemies usually will say something before attacking you, thus when you start dialogue with them and close it
the battle screen will show up.
NPC's are not implemnted yet but are planned
